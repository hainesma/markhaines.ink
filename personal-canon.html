<ul>
<li>Each of us is the center of the cosmos. This gives us, and makes us a source of, energy and power. We have the power to create meaning by willing it into being. We can hold space, create order, and build prosperity. We can have impactful action.</li>
<li>It is on each of us to maintain our individual sovereignty. Others will define our narrative for us if we let them.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="source-of-truth">Source of Truth</h3>
<ul>
<li>Truth emanates through the universe. It is logos, the generative principle of existence. It is a vibration, a sine wave, a tone, the Om. Growing out of this vibration are the archetypal truths of life. The first of these is balance. Light and dark exist in tension with each other. In many dimensions, balance turns into equilibrium of qualities and virtues.</li>
<li>Practically speaking, the answers we seek come from the quiet mind. Through quieting our thoughts and letting go of our fixations, we can feel what is true. We can also seek counsel from others who are in touch with truth. But notice that those who speak the loudest or have the largest audience may not be sources of truth.</li>
